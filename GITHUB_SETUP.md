# Publishing to GitHub - Step-by-Step Guide

Your hello-mcp-server repository is now ready to be published to GitHub! Follow these steps to push your project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (create one at https://github.com if you don't have one)
- Git installed on your machine (already confirmed)
- Your repository initialized with an initial commit (already done)

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com and log in to your account
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `hello-mcp-server`
   - **Description**: "A simple TypeScript MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with a friendly greeting tool"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private based on your preference
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hello-mcp-server.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v
```

If you prefer SSH (recommended for regular use):
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/hello-mcp-server.git
```

## Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch, so future pushes can be done with just `git push`.

## Step 4: Update README Links

After pushing, update the README.md file to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Edit README.md to update the URLs
# Replace all instances of YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
```

Then commit and push the changes:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update GitHub URLs with correct username"
git push
```

## Step 5: Configure Repository Settings (Optional)

Once your repository is on GitHub, you might want to:

1. **Add Topics**: Go to repository settings and add topics like "mcp", "typescript", "model-context-protocol"
2. **Set up GitHub Pages**: If you want to host documentation
3. **Enable Issues**: Should be enabled by default
4. **Configure Branch Protection**: For main branch (if working with others)

## Step 6: Verify Everything Works

1. Visit your repository at `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hello-mcp-server`
2. Check that all files are present
3. Verify the README displays correctly with working badges
4. Test cloning your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hello-mcp-server.git test-clone
   cd test-clone
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Permission Denied (publickey)
If you get this error with SSH, you need to set up SSH keys:
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key and add to GitHub settings
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### Remote Already Exists
If you already added a remote:
```bash
# Remove the existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add the correct one
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hello-mcp-server.git
```

### Wrong Branch Name
If your default branch is 'master' instead of 'main':
```bash
# Rename the branch
git branch -m master main

# Push with the new name
git push -u origin main
```

## Next Steps

After successfully publishing to GitHub:

1. **Share your repository** with others who might find it useful
2. **Create releases** when you add new features
3. **Set up GitHub Actions** for automated testing/building
4. **Add more MCP tools** to expand functionality
5. **Connect with the MCP community** and share your server

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

Your MCP server is now on GitHub and ready for collaboration. Happy coding!
